# 🎮 Simon Game

A classic **Simon Memory Game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Test your memory by repeating an increasingly complex sequence of colors!


## 🧠 How the Game Works

1. Press **any key** to start the game.
2. A random color button flashes — remember it!
3. Click the buttons in the **same order** as shown.
4. Each level adds **one new color** to the sequence.
5. A wrong move ends the game and displays your score.
